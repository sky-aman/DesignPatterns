# Gamma Cateorization

## Creational Patterns

* Deal with the creation (construciton) of objects.
* Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc.)
* Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step)

## Structural Patterns
* Concerned with the structure (eg. class members)
* Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface.
* Stress the importance of good API design.

## Behavioral Patterns
* Solve a particualar problem in specific way.
