# Prototyping

* Complicating objects aren't designed from scratch
 * They reiterate existing designs.
* An existing (partially or fully constructed) design is a Prototype.
* We make a copy (clone) the prototype and customize it.
 * Requires 'deep copy' support
* We make the cloning convenient (e.g. via a Factory)

## Prototype
<p>A partially or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of.</p>
