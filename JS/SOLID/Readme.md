# SOLID Design Principles

## Single Responsibility Principle
* A class should have only single responsibility.
* Seperation of concerns - independent tasks/problems

## Open-Closed Principle
* open for extension, closed for modification
* state space explosion

## Liskov Substitution Principle
* You should be able to substitute a base type for a subtype
* if a function takes base class then it should also take derived class without breaking any functionality.

## Interface Segregation Principle
* don't put too much into an interface; split into separate interfaces.
* don't break the principle of least surprise.
* YAGNI - You Ain't Going to Need It

## Dependency Inversion Principle
* defines a relationship between low-level modules and high level modules
* high level modules should not depend on low level modules, use abstractions
